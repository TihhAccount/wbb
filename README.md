# **WWB**
## Wordle, but bad. Simply that.

This is my first real project. Written in C++, no external libraries. Name sums it up well: Wordle, but bad.

### Compiling: 
Any compiler should really work, as no external libraries (like SDL) were used. 
Personally, I used MinGW, but any compiler for C++ should work
