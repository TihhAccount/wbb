## Wordle, but bad. Simply that.

This is my first real project. Written in C++, while currently not using any external libraries, in the future it will use SDL 3. Name sums it up well: Wordle, but bad.

### Compiling: 
Any compiler should really work, as no external libraries (like SDL) were used in the current version. In future versions though, SDL will be used.
Personally, I used MinGW, but any compiler for C++ should work
